                        <h2>Noisecontrollers</h2>
                        <p>Noisecontrollers, or Bas Oskam, is often referred to as being the King of Hardstyle. He's always been in the forefront on experimental sound designing that later sets the new standards. His sound sky rocketed after the main anthem to Inqontrol 2008 - Ctrl Alt Delete. The way he produced the kickdrum has forever 
                        changed the way Hardstyle is produced.
                        </p>

                        <p>He often produce euphoric tracks with fast paced but catchy melodies that will set your mood up high. His signature sound is so known by the average Hardstyle fan that most people recognize just a couple of seconds in to a new song that it's the work of Bas. Even if they don't actually know on before hand! </p>

                            <h2>Headhunterz</h2>
                            <p>The Prince of Hardstyle. The Legend. Or whatever people might call this man... Willem Rebergen is one of the most influencial persons on the scene. He was the one making the rather unusual Hardstyle basslines follow the main melody. His tracks is filled up with musical harmony, crisp sounding synths, huge atmospheres and ambiences. 
                            </p>
    
                            <p>His approach is more often than not circling around storytelling. Most of the time he touches the listeners urge to experience an emotional journey - making his music feel more like a soundtrack rather than ordinary music. This man never disappoints his audience and his sound is almost religiously serious. Headhunterz brought the musical harmony into a genre that most people still think is just hard and rough.</p>
